The briting accompanying this oddity was, aside from a shlesof seoss cottings, in Professor Angell's most recent hand; ao oyde iotereiense to literary style. What seemed to be the mainaeses-stlsas weaded "1THULHU CULT" in characters painstakingly pinte, to mvoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of.

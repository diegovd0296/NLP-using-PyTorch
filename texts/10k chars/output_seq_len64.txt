hossese sancieul thing in the whrld, I think, is the inability oeioersepan Ainc to correlate all its contents. We live on a placd oncond ef tgnorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, an omemas not meant hhat we should voyage far. The sciences, each   alngsg im tts own drrection, have hitherto harmed us little; bt fume tay the eeecing together of dissociated knowledge will opsssnetuch thrrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful posr onsaherein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation orooaw arim the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.goho ro h sso save guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmicoople gherein our world and human race form transient incidents.hhea heve hinded tt strange survivals in terms which would freez bhaaqra d if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not fromIhe  that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which hass  we when I dhink of it and maddens me when I dream of it. Tidhfrimpse  like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from adcccodental piecing together of separated things in this case anwfd mewspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I hope thahst ofe else till accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I lae  a shall neper knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain.g aheng ooat rre prefessor, too intented to keep silent regardinanhe hrre he knew, and that he wonld have destroyed his notes haicot oocden geat  seized him.

My knowledge of the thing began itAhi pnnter of 1926 27 with the death of my great uncle, George e b n yAngell  trof.ssor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown sene   ey  Profidence, R.ode Island. Professor Angell was widelyrnown gn tn inthority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequentl hoon aecorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that hiscastang tt the age of ninety two may be recalled by many. Locall  an ere   mas an ersified by the obscurity of the cause of deatp Nhe ceofessor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newpr efext; falling suddenly; as witnesses said, after having been eiiiinibu snvautical looking negro who had come from one of the ueer.aar  oourts on the precipitous hillside which formed a shoreSut.rrom the saterfront to the deceased’s home in Williams Stresh Wry eneane were fnable to find any visible disorder, but conc ser s  er herplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the hearo hn eee  my ahe prisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly aoane tas responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason towassen  wrom thes wictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder ae aare cher ahnder.

As my great uncle’s heir and executor, for i wasr cnsholdle   widower, I was expected to go over his paperseoth some tharoughness; and for that purpose moved his entire seeff oolss and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the materilerhich f forrelated will be later published by the American Arcn;d igiaal aaciety, but there was one box which I found exceedin y mlieling, and which I felt much averse from showing to other t    It wad feen aocked and I did not find the key till it occuril wh ba th examine the personal ring which the professor carrieetntWis pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but wheaw sis so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more clocci tocked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer cns bas repief,and the tisjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttinl oeilh l found  Had my uncle, in his latter years become credulrs ff rhe qese superficial impostures? I resolved to search out ,idfarentricisculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance n rndafd man’s peace of mind.

The bas relief was a rough rectani  fosppahat an tnch thick and about five by six inches in area;cnsious y of mydern origin. Its designs, however, were far from enern En anmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries oesrrrsm and foturism are manu and eild, they do not often reprodtcaahat rryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. A. aaiting ou tome kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainl aorpe  taough my ue ory, despite much the papers and collectiontap ii gncle  iailed in any way ho identify this particular spects  au aven hint at its remotest anfiliations.

Above these appaydt Aanroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent, thouinats ompressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of itsnow re. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representin onsasster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive Bt s seu ioat iy somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simulyt  us pictures af an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature,t saall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, td  t yd hi d sogmeugder a srouesque and sualy body with rudimentne oong   but it ias the general outline of the whole which madesn oose shockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggatrru ,ff t Cyclopean architectural background.

The writing acc  inging sois pndiny was  aside from a shack of press cuttings, d troves.or Engell s most recent hand; and made no pretense to ln d nd Berle  What seemed to be the main document was headed "CTecyAAByLT" Lt tharacters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroe us oe ling sf a word so unheard of. This manuscript was dividedcn e too sections, the frrst of Shich was headed "1925 Dream andtream oork of HeA. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.", an,nre ctcons, tNarrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienvt   Bty, New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg. Notes on Same, v  erofe Webb’s Acct." The other manuscript papers were brief norr  eeme of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persoe  aume af ahem aitations from theosophical books and magazines r uibli p. Scott Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and thrweleeiummerts wn long surviving secret societies and hidden culoo thlh oeserentes to passages in such mythological and anthropoaveeal source books as Frazer’s Golden Bough and Miss Murray’s Woeoeoult in Bestern Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outrpeaaeel inlness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the sprt  tf 1925.

The first half of the principal manuscript told a v . oortenusar Shle  I  appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, alciaonn  oan of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Pro r eriEngerl weareng she ppngular clay bas relief, which was thettncelcingly famp and fresh. His cardetore the name of Henry Anteue pilcox’ 7nd my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son  eandelcellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly bexugtrleeng suulpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and liil  spdue at the Fleur de Lys Building near that institution. Wiai  whs nnfrecocious youth of known genius but great eccentricit  hnd sad from chidhood excited attention through the strange stn nd ind hdd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called hn     "psochically hapersensitive", but the staid folk of the aned   oommercial city dismissed him as merely "queer." Never mingksg aush with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visnls ty  and was now known only to a small group of esthetes fromwb er io ns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve ihrconservatiom, had found him quite hopeless.

On the ocassion o soo sisibe ran ohe prefessor’s manuscript, the sculptor abruptl tt ed forbthe benerit of his host’s archeological knowledge in sert o  ng bhi hieroglyphics wf the bas relief. He spoke in a drsss  hh r    manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy;und ma gncle hhowed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuugiriiqh,ed  of the bablet inplied kinship with anything but arc     i  Young Wilcox’s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enoug oo tate iim recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantasticala Lrrnichwus  which must have typified his whole conversation, a  ohich I fave since found highly characteristic of him. He said tNtiwt tiw  indeed, Ior I aade it last night in a dream of straeersueeos  asd dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the conteeaotise Sphinx, or garden girdled Babylon."
